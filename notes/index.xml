whenever using a terminology or construction that has been defined elsewhere, link it. all notations (except the most very basic) should be recalled via a link.

A related point is that it should be possible to understand a note by (1) reading it, and (2) traversing the notes that it links to and recursively understanding those notes.
Traditional mathematical notes do not achieve this kind of atomicity: understanding the meaning of a particular node (e.</description></item><item><title>the neighbor relation in a hierarchy</title><link>https://www.jonmsterling.com/forest/notes/tfmt-0006/</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 Dec 2022 15:53:14 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://www.jonmsterling.com/forest/notes/tfmt-0006/</guid><description>Multiple hierarchical structures can be imposed on the same associative network of nodes. As a result, any interface for navigating the neighbor-relation would need to take account of all parent nodes.

In particular, the problem of circular reference must be grappled with immediately rather than incidentally: in ordinary knowledge management, circularity represents the completion of a train of thought, whereas in mathematical thinking it remains very important to distinguish assumptions from consequences.</description></item><item><title>existing tools for mathematical thought</title><link>https://www.jonmsterling.com/forest/notes/tfmt-0004/</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 Dec 2022 14:56:50 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://www.jonmsterling.com/forest/notes/tfmt-0004/</guid><description>The existing tools for mathematical thought can be divided into two main categories: interactive proof assistants and textual authoring and publishing tools (including $\LaTeX$, as well as the Gerby software that runs the Stacks Project).</description></item><item><title>evergreen notes</title><link>https://www.jonmsterling.com/forest/notes/tfmt-0003/</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 Dec 2022 14:41:59 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://www.jonmsterling.com/forest/notes/tfmt-0003/</guid><description>The phrase evergreen note is due to Andy Matuschak, who has written extensively about it in his public Zettelkasten.

Indeed, let $u,v\in \OpCat{E}\Sub{x}$ and fix a vertical map $h : u \to v\in \OpCat{E}\Sub{x}$; by unfolding definitions, we see that the vertical map $h : u \to v$ is uniquely determined by a morphism $v\to u\in E\Sub{x}$.
Proof. A displayed morphism $u\to\Sub{\Idn{x}} v\in \OpCat{E}$ is determined by a span $\brc{u\leftarrow v\Sub{x} \to v}\in E$ where the right-hand map is cartesian over $\Idn{x} : x\to x$ and the left-hand map is vertical, taken up to the identification of different cartesian lifts $v\Sub{x}\to x$.</description></item><item><title>externalization</title><link>https://www.jonmsterling.com/forest/notes/frct-001r/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.jonmsterling.com/forest/notes/frct-001r/</guid><description>Let $C$ be an internal category in $E$.

Proof. Any cartesian map is clearly hypocartesian. To see that a hypocartesian map $\bar{f}:\bar{x}\to\Sub{f}\bar{y}$ in a cartesian fibration is cartesian, we consider the cartesian lift of $f:x\to y$ under $\bar{y}$:
As the cartesian lift $\bar{x}\tick\to \bar{y}$ is also hypocartesian, it follows that there is a unique vertical isomorphism identifying $\bar{x}$ with $\bar{x}\tick$ factoring $\bar{f} : \bar{x}\to\Sub{f}\bar{y}$ through $\bar{f}\tick : \bar{x}\tick\to\Sub{f}\bar{y}$.</description></item><item><title>hypocartesian morphisms</title><link>https://www.jonmsterling.com/forest/notes/frct-002a/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.jonmsterling.com/forest/notes/frct-002a/</guid><description>Let $E$ be displayed over $B$, and let $f:x\to y \in B$; a morphism $\bar{f}:\bar{x}\to\Sub{f} \bar{y}$ in $E$ is called hypocartesian over $f$ when for any $\bar{u}\in E\Sub{x}$ and $\bar{h}:\bar{u}\to\Sub{f} \bar{y}$ there exists a unique $i : \bar{u}\to\Sub{\Idn{x}} \bar{x}$ with $i;\bar{f} = \bar{h}$ as follows:</description></item><item><title>internal categories</title><link>https://www.jonmsterling.com/forest/notes/frct-003o/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.jonmsterling.com/forest/notes/frct-003o/</guid><description>We have already seen in warmup: locally small family fibrations and globally small categories that smallness in the sense of the definition above appropriately generalizes the ordinary notion of smallness for categories over $\SET$.

Proof.

Hypocartesian morphisms more directly generalize the &amp;ldquo;little picture&amp;rdquo; universal property of pullbacks as limiting cones, whereas cartesian morphisms generalize the &amp;ldquo;big picture&amp;rdquo; dynamics of the pullback pasting lemma. As we have seen in hypocartesian = cartesian in a cartesian fibration these two notions coincide in any cartesian fibration; the instance of this result for the fundamental self-indexing verifies that pullbacks can be equivalently presented in terms of cartesian morphisms, as we have pointed out in #frct-001Y.</description></item><item><title>warmup: locally small family fibrations</title><link>https://www.jonmsterling.com/forest/notes/frct-000g/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.jonmsterling.com/forest/notes/frct-000g/</guid><description>An ordinary category $E$ is called locally small when for any $x,y\in E$ the collection of morphisms $x\to y$ is a set.

Consider an index set $I\in \SET$ and two families $u,v\in C^I$.
